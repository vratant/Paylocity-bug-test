Paylocity Bug Find test
UI - 
1. When adding/updating First name and Last Name value, it is getting swapped when seeing on Dashboard.(First Name value displayed in Last Name column and vice-versa)
2. How is "Benefits Cost" and "Net Pay" calculated?
3. What is the maximum value for "Dependants"?
4. If there are 2 or more employees with same First Name, Last Name and Dependants, so after entering details, how do we know which row is for which employee?(what is the differentiator)
5. Currency symbol is missing from all the numbers.
6. When session expires, dashboard is still visible. It should be directed to login page.




API - 
1. When adding values to first name and last name, value is getting swapped when seeing value on Dashboard. (First Name value displayed in Last Name column and vice-versa)
2. When updating value for an id which is not there on dashboard - a new row is being added to dashboard, but with $0 salary and $ gross pay and net is coming in negative value. Instead it should be displaying no value found for ID, or it should add new row with updated/correct salart and gross pay.
3. Delete comments are not getting updated on dashboard.
4. When doing "Get Employee List" - Dashboard value of Last Name and First Name is getting swapped when getting JSON value.(Dashboard.FirstName is going to JSON.LastName and vice-versa)
5. When updating value, dashboard needs to be refreshed and re-login is required.





Summary - 

The main observation is about FirstName and LastName Values getting swapped, when adding or updating values. Dashboard getting mismatch values. 
When moving to salary and benefits, need to know formula to calculate it, to verify correct calculated values. 
If there are 2 or more employees with same First Name, Last Name and benifits, it is creating confusion and there is no differentiator, 
how to delete or update a given employee belonging to same category. When updating value using API call, salary and gross pay are coming as $0, 
and Net pay is negative. Lets say there is no activity for sometime on dashboard, the session expires and dashboard is still visible but no activity can be done. 
Instead it should go to login page and do-auto logout. In dashboard all the amounts are missing '$' symbol. When trying to delete from API call, 
there is no activity on dashboard, so not sure if there is connectivity issue. How many maximum dependants can an Emplpyee have.
