API -

2. When updating value for an id which is not there on dashboard - a new row is being added to dashboard, but with $0 salary and $ gross pay and net is coming in negative value.

4. When doing "Get Employee List" - Dashboard value of Last Name and First Name is getting swapped when getting JSON value.(Dashboard.FirstName is going to JSON.LastName and vice-versa)
